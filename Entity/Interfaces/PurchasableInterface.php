 * Interface PurchasableInterface

 * a Purchasable is an object that:

 * * Has a SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) code
 * * Has stock attribute, reporting the purchasable availability.
 * * Implements ProductPriceInterface, so that prices can be read and written
 *
 * Using this consistent interface, services and classes that operate on
 * these features (such as CartManager) will have a shallow dependency
 * with more concrete product classes or interfaces
